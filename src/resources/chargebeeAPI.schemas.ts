 * The Usages API is used to record usage for metered item prices in a subscription. This API is only applicable when Automated Metered Billing is enabled in Chargebee.

Metered items are those that are billed based on the service usage. Common examples include:

* Internet data services.
* SMS send/receive services.
* API services that are billed for the number of API calls made, say, per month.



An [item](/docs/api/items) is marked metered by setting its `metered` attribute as `true`. Only recurring items can be can be set as `metered`. Recurring items are those of `type` `plan` or `addon`. A subscription can have both metered and non-metered items. The usages API (described in this page), is used to add, retrieve and delete usages for the metered items in a subscription.

#### Invoicing Metered Item Prices {#invoicing_usages_pcv2}

While non-metered items are invoiced in a prepaid manner at the beginning of each billing cycle; for metered items, the charges are raised at the end of the billing term (postpaid). During the course of the billing period, [usages can be added](usages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_usage) as and when they occur. For a given `subscription_id` and `item_price_id`, there can be only one usage record for a specific `usage_date`. At the end of each term, the invoice is generated with `status` as `pending`. Any remaining usage records can continue to be added to the subscription until the invoice [closes automatically](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/metered_billing.html#configuring-metered-billing) or is [closed via an API call](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice). If a usage record has erroneous information and you want to correct it, [delete the usage](usages?prod_cat_ver=2#delete_a_usage) and add it again.  
**Max Usages**   

* The maximum number of usages that can be recorded for the entire lifetime of a subscription is 5000. [Contact Support](https://chargebee.freshdesk.com/support/home) if you want this limit to be increased for your site.
* If there are no usages for an item price, the item price is not invoiced.

 * The subscription entitlement
object represents the entitlements a subscription has towards a feature. A
subscription can have multiple `subscription_entitlements`, each
corresponding to a feature it is entitled to. The `subscription_entitlement`
includes both the effective (or final) entitlement and its `components`.
The `components` consist of `inherited_entitlements`
and any `entitlement_overrides`.

Effective
and Component Entitlements {#types}
---------------------------------------------

The effective entitlement of a given
subscription towards a given feature is given by `subscription_entitlement.value`.
It is the final entitlement derived from the entitlement `components`.
There are two types of component entitlements:

* `inherited_entitlements`: Inherited entitlements are derived from the `item_entitlements` of the subscription's `items`. The following section describes how this works, providing examples for each feature `type`.
* `entitlement_overrides`: An overridden entitlement is that which is granted explicitly on the subscription for a feature. Such an entitlement, when present, becomes the effective entitlement for the subscription, thereby overriding any inherited entitlement towards the feature. An `entitlement_override` can be [temporary](/docs/api/entitlement_overrides#entitlement_override_expires_at) such that it expires at some point in time and is no longer returned. See [entitlement_overrides](/docs/api/entitlement_overrides).

How `inherited_entitlements.value`
is determined {#inheritance}
---------------------------------------------------------------

The `inherited_entitlements.value` is determined
from the `item_entitlements` of the items in the subscription and
based on `feature.type`:  

### When the `feature.type` is `quantity` {#quantity}

In this case,

* if any of the `subscription_item_entitlements[].values` is `unlimited`, then `inherited_entitlements.value` is also `unlimited`.
* otherwise, the `inherited_entitlements.value` is the sum of all the `subscription_item_entitlements[].values`.

#### Example {#quantity-content}

Consider the following...

* A `feature` of `type` `quantity`, named `User Licenses` has entitlement levels defined as:
  * `feature.levels[0].value` = `5`
  * `feature.levels[1].value`=`10`
  * `feature.levels[2].value`=`30`
* Also, `feature.levels[i].is_unlimited` is `false` for all values of `i`, which means that the feature has no `Unlimited` level.
* A quantity-based plan-item named `Standard` has entitlements to the above feature defined as `item_entitlement.value` = `10`.
* A quantity-based addon-item `Extra licenses
  - small` has entitlements to the same feature defined as `item_entitlement.value` = `5`.
* A subscription contains:
  * `2` units of an item price under the plan-item `Standard`. Which is seen in the subscription as `subscription.subscription_items[0].quantity` = `2`.
  * `3` units of an item price `price-1` under the addon-item `Extra licenses - small`. Which is `subscription.subscription_items[1].quantity` = `3`
  * `4` units of an item price `price-2` under the addon-item `Extra licenses - small`. Which is `subscription.subscription_items[2].quantity` = `4`

We derive `inherited_entitlements.value` as follows:

1. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[i].item_entitlement_value` for both the items. The value is the same as `item_entitlement.value`, so we have:
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[0].item_entitlement_value` = `10` for the plan
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[1].item_entitlement_value` = `5` for the addon
2. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[i].subscription_item_quantity` for both the items:
   * For the plan-item, the value is the same as the item price quantity (`subscription.subscription_items[0].quantity`). So we have `subscription_item_entitlements[0].subscription_item_quantity`= `2`.
   * For the addon-item, since two item prices `price-1` and `price-2` have been added to the subscription, the quantity of the item price that was updated last in Chargebee is considered. If we assume `price-1` was updated last, then the quantity of `price-1` in the subscription is considered, which is `subscription.subscription_items[1].quantity`. So we have `subscription_item_entitlements[n].subscription_item_quantity`= `3`
3. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[].value` for the items. The value is given by `subscription_item_entitlements[i].item_entitlement_value` x `subscription_item_entitlements[i].subscription_item_quantity`, so we have:
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[0].value` = 10 x 2 = `20` for the plan.
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[1].value` = 5 x 3 = `15` for the addon.
4. Calculate `inherited_entitlements.value` as the sum of all the `subscription_item_entitlements[i].values`, so we have: 20 + 15 = `35` as the inherited entitlement of the subscription towards the feature named `User Licenses`.  

### When the `feature.type` is `range` {#range}

In this case,

* if any of the `subscription_item_entitlements[i].values` is `unlimited`, then `inherited_entitlements.value` is also `unlimited`.
* otherwise, the `inherited_entitlements.value` is the sum of all the `subscription_item_entitlements[i].values`. Additionally, when the value of `levels[i].is_unlimited` for the feature is `false` for values of `i`, and the sum of all `subscription_item_entitlements[i].values` exceeds `feature.levels[1].value` (the upper limit of the range), then `inherited_entitlements.value` is set to `feature.levels[1].value`.

#### Example {#range-content}

Consider the following...

* A `feature` of `type` `range`, named `API
  Rate Limit` has entitlement levels defined as:
  * feature.`levels[0].value` = `100`
  * `levels[1].value` = `1000`
* Also, `feature.levels[i].is_unlimited` as `false` for all values of `i`, which means that the feature has no `Unlimited` level.
* A quantity-based plan-item named`Standard` has entitlements to the above feature defined as `item_entitlement.value` = `400`.
* a quantity-based addon-item `API Boost
  - small` has entitlements to the same feature defined as `item_entitlement.value` = `100`.
* A subscription contains:
  * `2` units of an item price under the plan-item `Standard`. Which is seen in the subscription as `subscription.subscription_items[0].quantity` = `2`.
  * `3` units of an item price `price-1` under the addon-item `API Boost - small`. Which is `subscription.subscription_items[1].quantity` = `3`.
  * `4` units of an item price `price-2` under the addon-item `API Boost - small`. Which is `subscription.subscription_items[1].quantity` = `4`.

We derive `inherited_entitlements.value`, as follows:

1. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[i].item_entitlement_value` for both the items. The value is the same as `item_entitlement.value`, so we have:
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[0].item_entitlement_value` = `400` for the plan
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[0].item_entitlement_value` = `100` for the addon
2. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[i].subscription_item_quantity` for both the items:
   * For the plan-item, the value is the same as the item rice quantity (`subscription.subscription_items[0].quantity`) so we have: `subscription_item_entitlements[0].subscription_item_quantity` = `2`
   * For the addon-item, since two item prices `price-1` and `price-2` have been added to the subscription, the quantity of the item price that was updated last in Chargebee is considered. If we assume `price-1` was updated last, then the quantity of `price-1` in the subscription is considered, which is `subscription.subscription_items[1].quantity`. So we have `subscription_item_entitlements[1].subscription_item_quantity` = `3`
3. Determine `subscription_item_entitlements[i].value` for the items. The value is given by `subscription_item_entitlements[i].item_entitlement_value` x `subscription_item_entitlements[i].subscription_item_quantity`, so we have:
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[0].value` = 400 x 2 = `800` for the plan
   * `subscription_item_entitlements[1].value` = 100 x 3 = `300` for the addon
4. Calculate the sum of all the `subscription_item_entitlements[i].values`, so we have: 800 + 300 = `1100`
5. Determine `inherited_entitlements.value`: Since `feature.levels[i].is_unlimited` is `false` for all values of `i`, and the sum in the previous step exceeds the upper limit of the range (`1000`) given by `levels[1].value`, the `inherited_entitlements.value` is the same as `levels[1].value` which is `1000`. So `1000` is the inherited entitlement of the subscription towards the feature named `API Rate Limit`.  

### When the `feature.type` is `custom` {#custom}

In this case, the `inherited_entitlements.value` is the highest
of all `subscription_item_entitlements[].values`

#### Example {#custom-content}

Consider the following...

* A `feature` of type `custom`, named `Email Support` that has entitlement levels defined as `levels[0].value` = `"email"`, `levels[1].value` = `"24x5"`, and `levels[2].value` = `"24x7"`.
* A plan-item named `Standard` has entitlements to the above feature defined as `item_entitlement[i].value` = `"24x5"`.
* An addon-item `Premium Support` has entitlements to the same feature defined as `item_entitlement.value[j]` = `"24x
  7"`.
* A subscription subscribes to the `Standard plan` with the `Premium Support` addon.

In this case,
`inherited_entitlements.value` = `24x7`, which is the
highest of `24x5` and `24x7` as determined by their
relative positions in the `feature.levels[].value` list.  

### When the `feature.type` is `switch` {#switch}

In this case, the `inherited_entitlements.value` is set to
`true` when any of the `subscription_item_entitlements[].values` is `true`.

Item price compatibility in a subscription {#item-price-compatibility}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When creating or updating a subscription, one of the item prices specified under subscription_items must be a plan-item price. The remaining must be compatible addon- or charge-item prices. An item price is compatible with a plan-item price if their currencies are the same. Additionally, an addon-item price is compatible with a plan-item price only if their billing frequencies meet the following conditions:

| `period_unit` for plan-item price | Compatible `period_unit` for addon-item price |                                                                                                                                                                                                   Compatible period for addon-item price                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

/**
 * When offering subscriptions of products or services, each entity that is made available for sale is represented by an "item" object. Items therefore represent the various plans, addons or charges that you offer as part of your product catalog. Non-`metered` items are charged upfront in Chargebee, while `metered` items are charged at the end of the billing cycle, based on usage.

### Types of Items

There are three types of items and they're listed and explained here. Examples for each type are provided in the table that follows.

#### Plan-items or Plans

Plan-items are items that have a recurring charge and are an essential component of any [subscription](./subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2). Typically, plans represent a principal or key product or service in your catalog. They are charged at recurring intervals and often have other products or services offered along with them as addons and charges.

#### Addon-items or Addons {#addon-items}

Addon-items are items that are sold along with a plan and are charged for at recurring intervals.

#### Charge-items or Charges

Charge-items are items that are sold along with a plan but charged once (or each time) a specified event occurs. A charge can also be [applied to a customer](./invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_a_charge-item) without attaching to a subscription.

#### Examples

To help understand each type of item better, listed below are some examples of items from different business domains:

##### Non-Metered (SaaS)

* **Item Family:** A project management solution.
* **Plans:**
  * A "basic" plan offering a small set of features.
  * A "business" plan offering a larger set of features.
* **Addons:**
  * An analytics plugin that is available only with the "business" plan.
  * A reporting plugin, available with both the above plans.
* **Charges:**
  * Implementation charges.
  * Trial charges.



##### Non-Metered (E-commerce)

* **Item Family:** A printed news magazine.
* **Plans:**
  * Periodic issues of the magazine.
  * Periodic issues of the magazine, with digital content.
* **Addons:**
  * Supplementary online content.
  * Access to a year's worth of back issues.
  * Searchable access to all back issues.
* **Charges:**
  * Special edition books that are published every so often.



##### Metered

* **Item Family:** SMS delivery services.
* **Plans:**
  * A basic plan of up to 100K messages @ $0.03 per message.
  * A volume plan of 2M messages @ $0.01 per message.
* **Addons:**
  * An addon of 50K MMS messages @ $0.1 per message.
  * Instant messaging.
* **Charges:**
  * Automated Metered Billing is not applicable for charges.

/**
 * An invoice is a commercial document representing a sale of products/services offered by you to a customer. It enumerates all the charges, adjustments, payments, discounts and taxes associated with the sale.

An invoice is said to be a recurring one when it is has at least one charge for [a plan or an addon item price](./items?prod_cat_ver=2). It is a non-recurring one when it has charges for only charge-item prices or [one-time charges](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/charges.html).

The item prices for any given billing term of a subscription are billed via an invoice at the beginning of the term (unless the charges are left unbilled). However, item prices that belong to `metered` items are billed at the end of the term via a `pending` invoice that can [close automatically](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/metered_billing.html#configuring-metered-billing) or via [an API call](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice). Moreover, when there are no `metered` items in the subscription, the invoices can still be generated as `pending` while [creating](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items) or [updating](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items) a subscription.

#### Auto-collection

If [auto-collection](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/customers.html#auto-collection-status) is enabled, then immediately on invoice generation (or, in case of subscriptions that have `create_pending_invoices` as `true`, on [invoice closure](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#close_a_pending_invoice)), the [payment method](./customers?prod_cat_ver=2#customer_payment_method) on file is charged:

* If the payment succeeds, the invoice is marked as `paid`.
* On payment failure, the invoice is marked as `payment_due` and [dunning settings](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/dunning-v2.html) are taken into account for payment retries.
* If no retry attempts are configured, or when retries are exhausted, the invoice is marked as `not_paid`.
* the amount due is zero or negative, the invoice is immediately marked as `paid` and the balance, if any, is added to [excess payments](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/customers.html#excess-payments) for the customer.

* [Checkout a new subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_for_a_new_subscription)
* [Checkout changes to an existing subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#create_checkout_to_update_a_subscription)

* [Make payments for all due invoices](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#collect_now)
* [Extending a subscription](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#extend_subscription)

When you create a hosted page, it is available at a secure and unique URL. This URL can then be provided to your customer on your website or by other means such as email. On successful completion of the hosted page workflow by the customer, they are redirected to the `redirect_url` with the hosted page `id` and `state` passed as query string parameters. As soon as the redirection happens, [retrieve the hosted page](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#retrieve_a_hosted_page) to get details of the customer, subscription, invoice etc.

/**
 * ### Introduction

Whenever any important changes happen in your Chargebee site, they are recorded as events. An event contains data about affected resources and additional details such as when the change occurred. For example, when a subscription is cancelled due to non payment, an event `subscription_cancelled` is recorded.

### Webhooks {#webhooks_pcv2}

If webhooks have been [configured](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/webhook_settings.html#configure-webhooks) in Chargebee, events trigger those webhooks. If multiple webhooks have been configured, for every event, each webhook is called one after another. If a webhook call for an event fails or times out, it is retried based on a [fixed schedule](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/webhook_settings.html#automatic-retries). The webhook call is an HTTP POST with content type `application/json`.

/**
 * `subscriptions` inherit `item_entitlements` from `item`s that are in them. Even so, there are many reasons why you may want to override the inherited entitlements on a subscription:

* A customer wants access to a `feature` that the `item`s on their `subscription` are not entitled to.
* A customer wants a higher `feature.level` without having to pay more.
* A customer does not want to see or access a `feature` because it is irrelevant to them.
* You offer customized `feature` bundles for each `subscription` instead of grouping `feature`s into a product catalog of `item`s.

This API helps you implement each of the above use cases by providing you a way to specify the `entitlement_overrides` `component` for any `subscription_entitlement`. Such an override, when present, becomes the effective entitlement, thereby overriding any `inherited_entitlements` for the `subscription`.  
**`entitlement_override` expiry**

If [expires_at](/docs/api/entitlement_overrides#entitlement_override_expires_at) has been set, then the `entitlement_override` object is no longer returned after `expires_at` has passed. The expiration of an `entitlement_override` does not trigger any event immediately. However, after expiry, the `entitlement_override `record gets deleted within 12 hours. This deletion triggers the `entitlement_overrides_auto_removed `event which can be considered as a notification, albeit delayed, for one or more `entitlement_overrides `having expired.

/**
 * A `discount`, just like [coupons](/docs/api/coupons), represents a deduction from the amounts in an `invoice`. While coupons are typically used by your customers, `discount`s can be directly applied to subscriptions by your sales team while negotiating new deals or upgrades. If the negotiations are on the price itself, the [price override](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/price-override.html#api) feature helps adjust the price further.

Although a `discount` appears as a deduction on an invoice, it is applied to a `subscription` while creating or updating the `subscription`. Every `discount` in Chargebee is attached to only one `subscription`.  
**Note:**

* The sum of the line-item-level and invoice-level coupons together for a subscription, cannot exceed 10.
* When discounts are enabled in Chargebee, the [multi-coupons feature](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/coupons.html#applying-multiple-coupons-to-a-subscription) is automatically activated.



Adding a discount
-----------------

### Subscriptions

A `discount` can be added to a `subscription` by calling either [Create subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#create_subscription_for_items) or [Update subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items). Once added, the `discount` is applied to all subsequent invoices if `apply_on` is set to `invoice_amount`. When `apply_on` = `specific_item_price`, the discount is applied (as a `discount.line_item_discount`) in each invoice of the subscription that contains the specified item.

### Invoices

A `discount` can be added to an `invoice` using [Create invoice for items and one-time charges](/docs/api/invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges) using the `discounts` parameter.

### Quotes

A `discount` can be added to a `quote` using the following operations:

* [Create a quote for new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_a_new_subscription_items)
* [Create a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_update_subscription_items)
* [Create a quote for charge and charge item](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#create_a_quote_for_charge_and_charge_items)
* [Edit a quote for a new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_create_subscription_quote_for_items)
* [Edit a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_update_subscription_quote_for_items)
* [Edit a quote for charge items and charges](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_quote_for_charge_items_and_charges)

### Estimates

A discount can be added to an estimate using the following endpoints:

* [Estimate for creating a subscription.](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_creating_a_subscription)
* [Estimate for creating a customer and subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_creating_a_customer_and_subscription)
* [Estimate for updating a subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_updating_a_subscription)

Removing a discount
-------------------

### Subscriptions

A `discount` can be removed by calling [Update subscription](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#update_subscription_for_items) with the relevant `discounts[operation_type][]` set to `remove`. Also, discounts that have `duration_type` as `one_time` or `limited_period` are removed automatically upon expiry.

### Quotes

A discount can be removed from a quote using the following operations:

* [Edit a quote for a new subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_create_subscription_quote_for_items)
* [Edit a quote for updating a subscription](/docs/api/quotes?prod_cat_ver=2#edit_update_subscription_quote_for_items)

### Estimates

A discount can be removed from an estimate using the following operation:

* [Estimate for updating a subscription](/docs/api/estimates?prod_cat_ver=2#estimate_for_updating_a_subscription)

Listing discounts
-----------------

A discount is associated with exactly one subscription. You can fetch all the discounts currently attached to a subscription by calling the [List discounts for a subscription API](/docs/api/subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2#list_discounts_for_a_subscription) or by passing `include_discounts` as `true` while creating, importing, updating or retrieving a subscription.

Order of application of coupons and discounts {#precedence}
-----------------------------------------------------------

When both <coupons> and <discounts> are applied simultaneously to a [subscription](subscriptions) or [one-time invoice](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges), they're applied in the following order:

For example, consider the following scenario:

A subscription is created with:

* a plan price of $200 per month
* an addon price of $20 per month
* a flat $5 invoice discount
* a 1% off coupon on the addon
* a flat $2 coupon on the invoice

The above coupons and discount are applied in the following order:  

|---|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|   | **Discount or coupon applied**              | **Subtotal at each step**                     |
| 1 | Initial subtotal (plan price + addon price) | $200 + $20 = $220                             |
| 2 | 1% off coupon on the addon                  | $200 + $(20 - 0.02) = $200 + $19.98 = $219.98 |
| 3 | Flat $2 coupon on the invoice               | $219.98 - $2 = $217.98                        |
| 4 | Flat $5 invoice discount                    | $217.98 - $5 = **$212.98**                    |

/**
 * Differential pricing helps implement a pricing strategy for addons and charges based on the plans they're purchased with. A differential price a specific price for an addon- or charge-[item price](./item_prices?prod_cat_ver=2) when purchased along with a particular plan.

Differential pricing for addons
-------------------------------

Consider an addon called 24x7 Customer Support provided with a cloud storage service. You can configure differential prices for each of the addon-item prices based on the plan they are purchased with, as follows:

|---|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
|   | **Addon item price**                                | **Price when applied to *Standard*** **Plan** | **Price when applied to** ***Enterprise*** **Plan** |
| 1 | 24x7 Customer Support, USD, Monthly, Flat fee, $100 | $90                                           | $150                                                |
| 2 | 24x7 Customer Support, USD, Yearly, Flat fee, $1000 | $900                                          | $1500                                               |

Differential pricing for charges
--------------------------------

Consider a charge, called Setup fee, for installing and configuring a cloud-based project management platform. There are two modes in which you can set up differential pricing for a charge:

#### Mode A: One charge differential price per plan-item

This mode is used to specify one differential price for the charge-item price per [plan-item](./items?prod_cat_ver=2) it is applied to.

|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Charge-item price**         | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan** | **Price when applied to** ***Enterprise*** **plan** |
| Setup fee, USD, Flat fee $500 | $400                                              | $700                                                |

#### Mode B: Multiple charge differential prices per plan item

This mode is used to specify multiple differential prices for the charge per plan-item, based on the plan period.

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Charge-item price**         | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan, 6 months** | **Price when applied to** ***Standard*** **plan, yearly** |
| Setup fee, USD, Flat fee $500 | $400                                                        | $300                                                      |

 * Overview {#overview}
--------------------

Coupons are deductions applied to invoices or invoice line items. They're designed to be consumed by your customers directly. A coupon deduction can either be for a fixed amount or for a percentage of the amount of the invoice or line item.  
**Note:**

If you wish to provide discounts to your customers via API or the Chargebee app, see [Discounts API](/docs/api/discounts)

Order of application of coupons and discounts {#precedence}
-----------------------------------------------------------

When both <coupons> and <discounts> are applied simultaneously to a [subscription](subscriptions) or [one-time invoice](invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges), they're applied in the following order:  
{#c8112732-82d8-406d-adad-a832fcb071a5}

|---|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 1 | Line-level, fixed amount coupons      | `coupon` with apply_on{#a9499b7a-8534-4a0c-b4d4-e66ab1dc88d9} = `each_specified_item` and `discount_type` = `flat` |
| 2 | Line-level, fixed amount discounts    | `discount` with `apply_on` = `specific_item_price` and `type` = `fixed_amount`                                     |
| 3 | Line-level, percentage coupons        | `coupon` with `apply_on` = `each_specified_item` and `discount_type` = `percentage`                                |

| 5 | Invoice-level, fixed amount coupons   | `coupon` with `apply_on` = `invoice_amount` and `discount_type` = `flat`                                           |

For example, consider the following scenario:

A subscription is created with:

* a plan price of $200 per month
* an addon price of $20 per month
* a flat $5 invoice discount
* a 1% off coupon on the addon
* a flat $2 coupon on the invoice

The above coupons and discount are applied in the following order:  

|---|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|   | **Discount or coupon applied**              | **Subtotal at each step**                     |
| 1 | Initial subtotal (plan price + addon price) | $200 + $20 = $220                             |
| 2 | 1% off coupon on the addon                  | $200 + $(20 - 0.02) = $200 + $19.98 = $219.98 |
| 3 | Flat $2 coupon on the invoice               | $219.98 - $2 = $217.98                        |
| 4 | Flat $5 invoice discount                    | $217.98 - $5 = **$212.98**                    |

/**
 * Subscriptions can run indefinitely or they may run for a fixed number of billing cycles. Subscription can have "contract terms", which define a lock-in period on the subscription for a certain number of billing cycles. This prevents the subscription from being canceled by the customer when it is within the contract term.

The **contract term** resource described below, defines the properties of this lock-in period. This includes the [number of billing cycles](contract_terms#contract_term_remaining_billing_cycles), the [total contract value](contract_terms#contract_term_total_contract_value), the [action to be taken](contract_terms#contract_term_action_at_term_end) at the end of the contract term, and so on. To allow for exceptions, you also have the option of terminating an [`active`](contract_terms#contract_term_status) contract term and charging a [termination fee](contract_terms#termintation_fee).

A contract term starts in the `active` state and ends in the `completed` state. If the contract was canceled due to non-payment or other reasons, it can end in the `canceled` or `terminated` state. A given contract term is always associated with one, and only one subscription. A subscription, however, can be associated with only one `active` contract term. Over time, a subscription can be associated with several non-`active` contract terms. The `active` contract term for a subscription is available as an [object](subscriptions#subscription_contract_term) within the subscription.

To enable and configure contract terms, follow these steps in the Chargebee UI:

1. Click **Settings** on the left navigation.
2. Click **Configure Chargebee**.
3. Under **Billing** , click **Contract Terms**.
4. Enable and configure the feature as needed.

Once contract terms have been configured, the following actions can be performed using the API:

* **Define a contract term** for a subscription and **set renewal options** for the contract term. The following endpoints support this:
  * [Create a subscription](subscriptions#create_a_subscription)
  * [Create subscription for customer](subscriptions#create_subscription_for_customer)
  * [Update a subscription](subscriptions#update_a_subscription)
  * [Reactivate a subscription](subscriptions#reactivate_a_subscription)
* **Retrieving** a historical record of all contract terms for a subscription can be done via the following endpoint:
  * [List contract terms for a subscription](subscriptions#list_contract_terms_for_a_subscription)
* **Canceling a contract term** can be done via the following endpoints:
  * [Update a subscription](subscriptions#update_a_subscription)
  * [Cancel a subscription](subscriptions#cancel_a_subscription)

<!-- -->

#### Including a termination fee

* When a contract is canceled mid-term, you can set a termination fee to be levied. Here's how:
1. [Create the termination fee as a `non_recurring` addon](addons#create_an_addon_charge_type).
2. [Associate this addon with a plan](plans#plan_event_based_addons) or [include the addon to a subscription](subscriptions#subscription_event_based_addons). In either case, set the `event_based_addons[on_event]` parameter to `contract_term_termination`.
* Once the above steps are done, the termination fee will be charged automatically if you [terminate the contract in the middle of its term](subscriptions#cancel_a_subscription_contract_term_cancel_option).

/**
 * Addon-item and charge-item prices are purchased with plan-item prices in subscriptions. You can automate this process by configuring certain addons and charges as "attached" to certain plans. This is done at the "item" level. In other words, addon- and charge-items can be attached to plan-items.

Once the attachment is defined, while creating or updating a subscription, the addon- or charge-item prices are selected automatically based on the plan-item price selected . Let's look at the details:

### Addons

Addons can be attached to plans as `recommended`, `mandatory` or `optional`.

* When an addon is attached as `recommended` for a plan, the addon is suggested to be applied to subscriptions for the plan in [Checkout](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/configure-inapp.html#fundamental-settings_recommending-addons-in-checkout) and [Self-Serve Portal](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/inapp-self-serve-portal.html#allow-change-subscription). Alternatively, if you build your own payment pages or have a sales team, you can suggest recommended addons to your customers or salespeople on your website or CRM respectively
* When an addon is attached as `mandatory` for a plan, the addon gets applied to subscriptions for the plan compulsorily, unless [removed explicitly](./subscriptions?prod_cat_ver=2). If you do not pass an item price for a mandatory addon when including the plan in a subscription, an addon-item price is automatically applied as explained below.
* Attaching an addon as `optional` neither marks it as recommended or mandatory but allows you a way to set a `quantity` and `billing_cycles` for the addon, for when it is applied to subscriptions with the plan.

How auto-selection of the addon-item price works
------------------------------------------------

Once an addon has been attached as mandatory, the addon-item price to be applied to the plan-item price is selected based on the following rule: The addon-item price with the same currency as that of the plan-item price and the longest compatible period is selected.

Here's an example:

Consider a plan **Standard Cloud Storage** has an addon **Extra Storage** attached to it. Note that each of the two are items. Now consider that they have item prices with the following periods and currencies:

**Item price for "Standard Cloud Storage" plan-item:**

* Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD.

**Item prices for "Extra Storage" addon-item:**

* Extra Storage, 1 year, EUR.
* Extra Storage, 1 year, USD.
* Extra Storage, 1 year, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 2 years, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 30 months, AUD.

For the plan-item price (Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD), the addon-item prices with matching currencies are the last 4 from the above list:

* Extra Storage, 1 year, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 2 years, AUD.
* Extra Storage, 30 months, AUD.

From among them, the last two have periods that are incompatible with the plan-item price period of 3 years. From the remaining 2 addon-item prices, the one with the longest period is of 18 months. So, "Extra Storage, 18 months, AUD" is selected for mandatory application to the plan item price.

### Charges

Charges can also be attached to plans. When doing so, you specify [the event](./attached_items?prod_cat_ver=2#attached_item_charge_on_event) at which the charge is to be applied to the subscription. For some events that can occur multiple times in a subscription lifetime, you can also set whether to apply the charge each time the event occurs or just once.

There may be multiple item prices for a given attached charge. The item price that matches the currency of the plan-item price is automatically selected for application.

Here's an example:

Consider a plan **Standard Cloud Storage** has a charge named **Implementation Fee** attached to it. Now consider their item prices below, with the following periods and currencies:

**Item price for "Standard Cloud Storage" plan-item:**

* Standard Cloud Storage, 3 years, AUD.

**Item prices for "Implementation Fee" charge-item:**

* Implementation Fee, USD.
* Implementation Fee, AUD.
* Implementation Fee, EUR.

From among the charge-item prices above, the one compatible with the plan-item price is "Implementation Fee, AUD" since it has the same currency as the plan-item price.

/**
 * The invoice for a subscription in Chargebee is generated at the time of subscription renewal. Invoices can also be [generated in advance](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/advance-invoices.html) for an upcoming renewal or set of renewals. With Advance Invoicing Schedules, you can set up a plan for when such advance invoices are generated for the lifetime of the subscription. This helps you:

* Set up a contract with your customers so that they can be notified of their payment schedules in advance.
* Allow customers who make offline payments to be alerted about their upcoming dues well ahead of actual subscription renewals.
* Prevent post-renewal unpaid usage of your services by customers.

Advance invoices can be scheduled in two ways:  

#### Specific Dates Schedule

Advance invoices for a subscription can be scheduled to be generated on specific [dates](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_specific_dates_schedule_date) in the future. You must specify the [number of billing cycles](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_specific_dates_schedule_terms_to_charge) to be invoiced on each date. A maximum of 5 dates can be specified.  

#### Fixed Interval Schedule

Advance invoices can be scheduled to be generated at fixed intervals of time, where each interval spans the same number of billing cycles of the subscription. The invoice for each interval is generated a specified number of days ([`days_before_interval`](advance_invoice_schedules#advance_invoice_schedule_fixed_interval_schedule_days_before_renewal)) before the start of the interval. You can configure the schedule to end on a certain date or after a specified number of advance invoices have been generated.

The start date of the first interval depends on the number of days remaining from current time till the next renewal of the subscription. If this is more than `days_before_interval`, the interval begins at the next renewal. On the other hand, if the number of days remaining before the next renewal is less than `days_before_interval`, the first interval begins at the renewal following the next.

For example if the payment method is card, this will include all card parameter validation errors and also verification failures from the gateway. \* \`payment_processing_failed\` - Returned when the payment collection fails. \* \`resource_limit_exhausted\` - Returned when any limit constraint is violated by the request. For example this error is thrown when the coupon provided has already expired or its maximum redemption count has been reached. \* \`duplicate_entry\` - Returned when the request provides a duplicate value for an attribute that is specified as unique for that site. For example in 'create subscription api' if you are passing the subscription id then this error will be thrown if a subscription exists in site with the same id. \* \`param_wrong_value\` - Returned when the value does not meet the required specification for the parameter. For example, wrong email format. It is strongly recommended to do the validation at your end before calling Chargebee's API (other than specific cases like VAT number validation). \* \`payment_method_not_present\` - Returned when the request requires payment collection but the 'payment method' details (such as card) is not present for the customer. This error will not occur if auto-collection is disabled for the customer. \* \`resource_limit_exceeded\` \* \`payment_gateway_currency_incompatible\` - Returned when the payment gateway configured is incompatible with the transactional currency. This error will not occur if auto-collection is disabled for the customer.
