 * Create a Chargebee hosted page to accept payment details from a customer and checkout [charge-items](./items?prod_cat_ver=2) and [one-time charges](./invoices?prod_cat_ver=2#create_invoice_for_items_and_one-time_charges).

The following steps describe how best to use this API:

1. Call this endpoint, providing [item prices](./item_prices?prod_cat_ver=2), [charges](./items?prod_cat_ver=2), [coupons](./coupons?prod_cat_ver=2) and a host of other details such as billing and shipping addresses of the customer, to be prefilled on the checkout page.
2. Send the customer to the Checkout `url` received in the response.
3. Once they complete checkout, the set of charge-items and one-time charges are automatically invoiced against the respective `customer` record in Chargebee, and they are redirected to the `redirect_url` with the `id` and `state` attributes passed as query string parameters.
4. [Retrieve the hosted page](./hosted_pages?prod_cat_ver=2#retrieve_a_hosted_page) at this stage to get the invoice details.

#### Customer resource lookup and creation {#customer_lookup1}

When [customer[id]](/docs/api/hosted_pages#checkout_charge_items_and_one_time_charges_customer_id) is provided for this operation, it is looked up by Chargebee, and if found, the hosted_page is created for it. If not found, a new customer resource is created with the ID provided, and the hosted_page is created.

##### Multiple business entities

If multiple [business entities](/docs/api/advanced-features#mbe) are created for the site, the customer resource lookup and creation happen within the [context](/docs/api/advanced-features#mbe-context) of the business entity [specified](/docs/api/advanced-features#mbe-header-main) in this API call. If no business entity is specified, the customer resource lookup is performed within the [site context](/docs/api/advanced-features#mbe-context) , and if not found, the resource is created for the [default business entity](/docs/api/advanced-features#mbe-default-be) of the site.

  /**
 * **Note:** If you're using [In-App Checkout](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/checkout.html), use [Manage Payment Sources API](/docs/api/hosted_pages#manage_payment_sources) to request your customers to update their payment method details or change their payment method.

Using this API, you can request your customers to update their payment method details or change their payment method. This is used in scenarios like customers updating their payment methods before the end of trial or customers switching among payment methods.

When this API is invoked, it returns a hosted page URL. When the customers are directed to this URL, they will be able to change/update their payment methods.

Depending on the payment methods (Card, PayPal Express Checkout, Amazon Payments) that you offer your customers, they will find options to switch among the various methods of payment.
**Note:**

* If the card\[gateway\] parameter is passed, and the customer chooses Card as a payment method, then the card details are stored in the gateway which is passed. However, if the card\[gateway\] parameter is passed and the customer chooses PayPal Express Checkout/Amazon Payments as a payment method, the gateway passed will be ignored.
* The option of embedding into an iframe is not supported for PayPal Express Checkout and Amazon Payments as customers are redirected to the respective website pages. Hence if you have PayPal Express Checkout/Amazon Payments configured and pass the parameter embed=true, this will result in an unsuccessful API request. Also, if you have all the three payment methods (Card, Paypal Express Checkout and Amazon Payments) configured and pass the parameter embed=true, the returned hosted page URL will show only Card Payment as a payment method.

#### Gift receiver customer resource lookup and creation {#receiver_lookup}

Once the gifter checks out using the hosted page returned by this endpoint, Chargebee checks if a customer resource with the receiver's email address exists. The first such customer record is considered the receiver's customer resource. A new customer resource is created for the receiver if none are found.

Chargebee recommends listening to appropriate webhooks such as [subscription_created](./events#subscription_created) or [invoice_generated](./events#invoice_generated) to verify a successful checkout.
